# IST 421 Lab 2
# Dr. Gregory Block

# we want to use special formatting to display our tables, so we need to install
# a 'package' called formattable; this is usually a one-time action (unless there)
# are updates to the package

#install.packages('formattable')

# however, whenever we want to USE the package after it's downloaded, we
# need to specify the library in each R module using the library command
library(formattable)


```

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like the example below.

Notes - to knit to PDF, you may need to install miktex

```{r mtcars, echo=TRUE}
# the purpose of this exercise is to use the R Markdown feature to 
# work with data frames and generate plots

# first we display characteristics of the mtcars data frame
# the summary command will display characteristics of each of the
# variables in the mtcars data frame
colnames(mtcars)
summary(mtcars)

# next we want to display the contents of the mtcars data frame
# using the formattable library
formattable(mtcars)

```

```{r mtcarsplot, echo=TRUE}

# next we can try generating a simple plot

plot(mtcars$hp, mtcars$mpg, main='mpg vs horsepower',
     xlab='horsepower', ylab='MPG', pch=19, col='blue')
```
```{r newdata, echo=TRUE}

# next let's create a new data frame

# a data frame is like a 2-dimensional list; the data frame is comprised
# of rows (like a list) and each element in the list of rows is described
# by one or more columns

# the columns have names, which you can list using the colnames function
# columns are also called variables

burrows <- data.frame(name = c('Felix', 'OddOne', 'Scamp', 'Blue'), 
                      dug = c(21, 12, 17, 14),
                      age = c(47, 23, 2, 14))
colnames(burrows) # name, dug, age
formattable(burrows)

```

More exercises in plotting...

```{r plotdata, echo=TRUE}

# next let's create a new plot using the burrows data frame and
# the plot definition from a prior lesson

# to access 

myColors <- c('green', 'red', 'purple', 'blue')

# we want to plot the depth of the burrows each tortoise dug, so
# we will access the 'dug' variable from the burrows data frame
# to do so we use the subset operator $, as in burrows$dug

# we can also access the tortoises' names by accessing the name variable
# as in burrows$name
barplot(burrows$dug, main = 'Tortoise burrows', ylab = 'Feet', xlab = 'Tortoise',
        horiz = TRUE,
        col = myColors,
        names.arg = burrows$name)

```

Another data frame example

```{r moredata, echo=TRUE}

# use set.seed to generate repeatable results
set.seed(123)

# generate sample data in the x and y variables; note that we are reusing
# the x variable from the start of the lecture

x <- rnorm(5000)
y <- x + rnorm(5000)

# inspect the two variables
summary(x)
summary(y)

```

And finally, generate multiple plots in a panel

```{r moreplots, echo=TRUE}

# change the default parameters to allow more than one plot in a panel
par(mfrow = c(1, 3))

# now generate three plots in the same panel
hist(x, main = 'The x distribution')
hist(y, main = 'The y distribution')
plot(x, y)

```
