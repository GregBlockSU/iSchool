Overall:

Good work on the report comparing the decision tree to the Naïve Bayesian models for the digit classification problem.

These assignments are graded based on the following rubric:

Introduction - 25 points: 

Identifying the data source, data characteristics and experimental setup.
EDA + Preprocessing - 25 points:

Data cleansing, preparation and exploration, attribute reduction techniques such as PCA,  and validation using crossfold or other techniques
Modeling - 25 points:

Analyzing the digit data set using the decision tree and Naïve Bayesian classifiers
Conclusions - 25 points:

Comprehensive summation that clearly followed from the analysis.
