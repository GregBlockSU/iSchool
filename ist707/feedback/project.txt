, your report was graded as follows:

Introduction, background, problem statement (25/25)
You tackled an innovative and really interesting problem - Kaggle movie data with critic and audience reviews, over 17K observations and 22 variables

Data selection, cleaning and exploration (25/25)
Dataset selection - good choice of a challenging data set from Kaggle

Data cleaning - fantastic work - you really left nothing to chance with the level of detail in your data cleansing, and the number of attributes you reviewed 

Exploratory data analysis - EDA is a very important part of any data driven process. Blindingly throwing machine learning solutions at data can lead to ill-conceived interpretations and recommendations.  

Plots and graphs - really good integration of background descriptions and plots/graphs, very thorough dissection of categorical and time-series information.

Analysis (25/25)
Analytical method - Excellent work on the association rule mining for both critic and audience ratings

Great work on the classification models, using decision tree, svm, knn and random forest. You also did a good job explaining the tuning parameters, and comparing and explaining model accuracy

Code integration - code provided support to the discussion of each model, as expected.

Plots and graphs - really good use of graphs to highlight the features of each model and to compare accuracy, training and prediction times

Conclusion, Summary or recommendations (25/25)
This is the end result. Key decisions and recommendations are often gleaned from the conclusions! What did you learn? What recommendations / results were made and observed? Clarity and accuracy are key here.

Excellent work on your conclusions evaluating the performance characteristics and outcomes of each model.

Good clear conclusion. This was truly an excellent effort and well executed! An amazing overall submission.
