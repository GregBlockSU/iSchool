# EDA and Data Viz

# Observation: To be considered 'ahead' in any way, there are two categories:
# 'Very Ahead' and 'Completed'. There are 3 cateories in place to describe
# 'behind' which may lead the responses to be lopsided in favor of generally
# 'behind' over 'generally ahead'. What other observations have you made?? Note
# them and clean the data appropriately.

# Note: There is a gap between middling and completed, meaning that the only

#
# There is no category that describes between 'Middling' and 'Very Ahead'. This
# means that survey respondents would have to decide between 'middling' or 'Very
# Ahead'; should they fall in the middle? This may skew the data towards one
# side or the other, however (Assumption) it is reasonable to assume that survey
# respondents would stick to a more honest 'Middling Answer' rather than
# exaggerating their students' success.

# Further Note: The data seems to be centered on the 'Behind' category, and by a
# large margin.

# More observations:
#  - 14% of students are on track in the middling category.
#  - Nearly 20% of students have completed the program.
#  - Nearly 50% of students in this program are in the 'behind' category alone.
#  - Students in the bottom two categories make up 20% of the sample. Meaning ~70% of students are behind in the curicculum.

# So, lets break the data down into individual schools to see if we can better

# Initial Observations and Remarks

# Observe:

 # - Schools B and D do not follow the same picture that was shown by the data combined. 
 # - A, C, and E follow generally the same pattern as shown by figure 1
 # - B shows many students ahead of the curriculum, completing the program. 
 # - The majority of students that are behind are behind by 1-5 assignments and very few are in the lowest two categories. 
 # - This is the most positive picture that the data shows out of the schools.
 # - School D is the opposite with a small percentage of students having completed all assignments and a large percentage of students being considered 'Very Behind'. 

# Comparing the two schools as a representation of the population of program
# takers ...

sum(StudentSumsB)/sum(StudentSums)

sum(StudentSumsD)/sum(StudentSums)

# School D has a small number of students, meaning that the data from school D
# has a greater probability of not being representative of the situation and may
# be acconted for by random chance. School B is a sample that is approximately
# one quarter of the overall population, making it more representative of the
# situation. It also shows that school B is doing something that the rest of the
# schools are not in order to get students through the course.

#looking at the data to determine quality sections
