Excellent work on assignment 3, $. The R code and graphs are correct, and your explanations are thorough.

I graded on the following responses:
Exercise 2. (.5 points)
Name the four variables of the dataset; Describe the second dimension number in the output

Exercise 3. (.5 points)
Run the summary head and mean commands, say what the command does, report the output, and briefly explain each piece of output

Exercise 4. (1 point)
Create a histogram for that variable. Then write code that will display the 2.5% and 97.5% quantiles; write an interpretation of the variable, including descriptions of the mean, median and shape of the distribution; Make sure to clearly describe what the 2.5% and 97.5% quantiles signify, then write an interpretation of the variable, including mean, median

Exercise 5. (1 point)
Use a sample size of n = 9 (sampling with replacement); Show a histogram of this distribution of sample means. Then, write and run R commands that will display the 2.5% and 97.5% quantiles of the sampling distribution on the histogram with a vertical line

Exercise 6. (1 point)
describe, the difference is between a distribution of raw data and a distribution of sampling means; then comment on why the 2.5% and 97.5% quantiles are so different between the raw data distribution and the sampling distribution of means

Exercise 7 (1 point)
Redo Exercise 5, but this time use a sample size of n =180 (instead of the original sample size of n = 13 used in Exercise 5); Explain why the 2.5% and 97.5% quantiles are different from the results you got for Exercise 5
