$, great work on the week 7 assignment. You correctly analyzed the correlation coefficient of and rejected the NULL hypothesis in the rock dataset using the correlation t-test. You also correctly defined a function to calculate the Bayes factor t-test for the same dataset. You also correctly calculated the Bayes factor for the admissions data, and described the contingency table and difference in admission proportion based on gender.
