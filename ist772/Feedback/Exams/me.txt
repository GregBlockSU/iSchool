Excellent work on the midterm exam, $. Your analysis was correct for questions 1-5, where you provided tests for the Confidence intervals and hypothesis testing, as well as the Bayes simulation. 

For questions 6-7 where you provided detailed narrative of the study that compared the proposed biofilm to traditional mechanical filtering, your descriptions were detailed and persuasive, and tailored correctly to the target audience.

I was highly impressed with how you rewrote the assignment into a holistic narrative that blended the numerical outputs from the R code, graphs and your interpretation of the treatment and control samples. 
Again, great work!
