    "# Twitter Sentiment Analysis using Python\n",
    "This project aims to conduct sentiment analysis of a particular topic by parsing the tweets fetched from Twitter using Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is sentiment analysis?\n",
    "Sentiment Analysis is the process of ‘computationally’ determining whether a piece of writing is positive, negative or neutral. It’s also known as opinion mining: deriving the opinion or attitude of a speaker or set of speakers.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Benefits of Sentiment Analysis\n",
    "### Business \n",
    "In marketing, companies use sentiment analysis to develop strategies, understand customers’ attitudes towards products or brands, learn how people respond to strategies, campaigns, or product launches, and gain deeper insight into why consumers may or may some products, support some teams or companies, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Politics\n",
    "In politics, SA is used to keep track of political points of view, to detect consistency and inconsistency between statements and actions at the government level when election monitoring, and also as a proxy for election predictions / who will win.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Public Actions\n",
    "Sentiment Analysis is also used to monitor and analyze social phenomena. For instance, the intelligence community uses SA to track potentially dangerous situations and determine the general mood of the blogosphere in high threat areas, or in cases where they have a criminal suspect that they are monitoring, or network of such, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Project Programs / Packages Needed:\n",
    "For this project, Tweepy and Textblob will be utilized. Tweepy is the python client for the official Twitter API, and Textblob is a python library used for processing textual data (which are what Tweets are!). Finally we'll also use the Natural Language Tool Kit library (NLTK) in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Setup\n",
    "### Authentication\n",
    "In order to fetch tweets through Twitter's API, one needs to register an App through a twitter account. This was accomplished through the following actions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Navigated to https://apps.twitter.com/ and clicked: ‘Create New App’\n",
    "2) Completed the application details and made the mock application.\n",
    "3) Copied the necessary ‘Consumer Key’, ‘Consumer Secret’, ‘Access token’ and ‘Access Token Secret’ for app development.\n",
    "\n",
    "'Consumer Key': oUkORoc3PPmAChcnxwfSKbRFL\n",
    "'Consumer Secret': PmASGyF92keg7uTx8j4sNvRtWxzvw8Xm88rpxN7AqECj7YBLDe\n",
    "'Access Token': 65187050-L0WLjPJCAGuvcfQCYhqtJ95MtCPezJGWzhN9niDBa\n",
    "'Access Token Secret': C8OsEpteeL0s9xXoUU5wiip4plExftfIT72qfV7tc3xMf\n",
    "\n",
    "### Finally, on to implementing our program in Python!"

    "# Conclusion\n",
    "What can we learn from all of this? First and foremost, we can learn that SA (sentiment analysis) is tough. We as humans read things and interpret them based on our points of view. A computational method of analysis for that is inherently going to contain some biases, and so the question becomes - how can we overcome those biases to be more objective? Things like language, context, past history, sarcasm, etc. are all phenomena we consider as humans when we assess the \"sentiment\" of a statement. When a computer does that, it can lead to some interesting results like with LaMelo Ball, the Iran Deal, or even Donald Trump.\n",
    "\n",
    "We also see, though, that in the case of Donald Trump for instance - the textblob SA package does a decent job. Of the latest 5,000 tweets, only about 30% of them are positive when referencing Trump, to 20% negative. That means about half are \"neutral\". We could potentially dive deeper and look at the netural tweets to see if they are coming from news organizations or supposedly \"unbiased\" journalists, to disprove \"fake news\" and bias claims for instance. However, we can see here that this is a narrow margin, which holds with our view of Trump in the publich sphere. He can sometimes be positive, but narrowly, thanks to his base. That holds true here (sic).\n",
    "\n",
    "So in closing, we took in live tweets, bucketed them by their sentiment score, and then played around with different queries to test our program. Business, politicians, and even public service officers can do the same to aid them in the completion of their daily jobs!"
