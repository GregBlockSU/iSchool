# PHP Restful API Starter Kit - Client

A starter kit for a handy PHP restful API client application. This client interacts with the PHP Restful API Starter Kit project found at: https://github.com/crmcmullen/medium-php-api-starter

New articles in the future will be features built upon this foundation.

This code accompanies my Medium article entitled, "How to Build a Simple Restful API in PHP"
